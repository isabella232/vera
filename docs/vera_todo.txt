### TODO
Cluster reconfigurations.
   - Testing, testing, testing.
   - How does the http message bus know about new peers?
VError everything
New leader pick up reconfiguration if leader dies during reconfig.
Read-only peers hanging off a non-leader (?)
Memory snapshot write to a stream rather than a big json object.
Add Flease to cliffsnotes.
"run random" and see what it does.
command log truncation.
request id logging through pipelines (should only be done in the server, no?)
Log (cumulative?) checksums
Separate out Raft deviations document.
All raft.js#TODOs
Raft action log that can turn into sequence diagram.
Tools:
  - add/remove/promote a new peer
  - force leader to step down
Leader regularly commits suicide as a chaos-monkey type thing.
Doc on using the memory raft repl (and tests).

### Overall todo:
* Solidly tested Raft Core
* API design and one api stubbed
* Other APIs
* Client

### Other tests
- Transitioning to candidate in the middle of a snapshot transfer.
- Client dying and coming back in waaaay later
- Updating term/status fails to persist to disk

### Examples of plaintext tests:
cluster of 3
set 0.leaderTimeout to 0
tick until 0.state is leader
tick 20
check 0.state is leader

cluster of 1
tick until 0.state is leader

cluster of 3
set 0.leaderTimeout to 0
tick until 0.state is leader
client foo bar baz
tick until 0.stateMachine.data is baz

cluster of 3
tick until cluster.hasLeader
new raft-3
client add raft-3

### Random questions
How do elections work with Cold,new?
How does an operator recover from something weird happening after the client
   request is sent off?

### Message Bus interface.

var messageId = self.messageBus.send(self.id, peer, message, onResponse);
self.messageBus.cancel(messageId);
